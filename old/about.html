            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Charlie. I am currently pursuing a dual degree in <strong>Computer Science & Engineering Technology</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. My passion lies in exploring the ever-evolving landscape of technology, from cybersecurity and ethical hacking to game development and backend systems. My ultimate goal is to contribute to digital security as an ethical hacker and penetration tester, creating secure and reliable systems in a world increasingly reliant on technology.</p>
            <br><br/>
            <h3>Education & Learning</h3>
            <p>My journey into technology has been both academically enriching and hands-on. Iâ€™ve dedicated my studies to fields such as <strong>malware analysis, ethical hacking, and web application security</strong>. Through a blend of coursework and personal projects, Iâ€™m continuously expanding my knowledge.</p>

            <p>In my academic life, I focus on both foundational principles and the latest advancements in technology. I am actively working on building a solid understanding of various programming languages like <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, along with web-based languages such as <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Each step brings me closer to mastering digital defense strategies and developing cybersecurity solutions.</p>
            <br><br/>
            <h3>Languages & Skills</h3>
            <p>I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript. While Iâ€™m still learning, I enjoy expanding my knowledge and applying what I learn to new projects. My primary focus is on Java and Python, which I frequently use for backend development and automation projects, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive and accessible web applications.</p>
            <p>Though I have some experience in C++, most of my skills are centered around Java, Python, and PHP, which allow me to develop both secure applications and responsive interfaces. As I continue to grow, I aim to broaden my knowledge in cybersecurity and enhance my abilities in web and software development.</p>
            
            <br><br/>
            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
            <p>Some of my recent projects reflect my passion for both gaming and cybersecurity. Iâ€™ve spent significant time developing Minecraft plugins that add unique, interactive features to the game, showcasing my abilities in Java programming and backend development.</p>
            <p>One of my most ambitious projects is <strong>Zombiecore</strong>, a Minecraft plugin that introduces challenging gameplay dynamics with custom arenas and loot management. Projects like these allow me to merge technical and creative thinking, applying my skills in game development and system architecture.</p>

            <p>Beyond gaming, Iâ€™m also actively involved in cybersecurity projects, such as developing tools for malware analysis and penetration testing. These projects provide valuable hands-on experience in digital security, preparing me for future roles as an ethical hacker. I document and share these projects on <a href="https://github.com/ch4rlesexe">GitHub</a>, where you can explore my work, check out new updates, and provide feedback.</p>
            <br><br/>
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, Iâ€™m eager to continue exploring cybersecurity, particularly in areas like ethical hacking and threat intelligence. I aim to complete certifications such as <strong>Security+</strong> and <strong>PenTest+</strong> to formally validate my skills. With a commitment to lifelong learning, Iâ€™m excited to see where my curiosity and drive for innovation will take me.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to the digital defense field, helping secure systems and protect data worldwide.</p>
